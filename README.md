## Riddle Rush

Browser-based team board game built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

### Persistence

Game state is saved to browser `localStorage`, so refreshing the page will not lose the current session. Use the **Reset Game** button in the header to clear saved state and start fresh.

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) on a machine connected to a projector.

### Tech stack

- React + Vite (no backend)
- Tailwind CSS
